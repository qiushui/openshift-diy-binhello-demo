These are the files used by the binhello demonstration for the
OpenShift DIY application type.

This git reposatory is not a working OpenShift application.  You
cannot simply push this git repo into OpenShift and have it run.

You have to go to the [walk through](https://openshift.redhat.com/community/blogs/a-paas-that-runs-anything-http-getting-started-with-diy-applications-on-openshift) at
and follow the directions there to install this demonstration.
